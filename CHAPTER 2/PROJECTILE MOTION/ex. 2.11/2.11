*2.11. In warfare you generally want to hit a particular target
(as opposed to having the cannon shells land indiscriminately).
However, this is not easy, since very small changes in any of the
parameters can lead to large changes in the landing site of the shell.
Investigate this by calculating how much the range of the cannon
shell considered in this section would change if the initial speed
is increased by 1 percent. Also compute the change in the range if
there is a slight (10 km/h) wind (this effect can be added using the
methods developed in the next section). You should find that even
these relatively small changes alter the landing site by quite significant amounts.
