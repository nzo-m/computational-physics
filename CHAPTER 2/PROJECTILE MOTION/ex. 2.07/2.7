Use the adiabatic model of the air density (2.24) to calculate
the cannon shell trajectory, and compare with results found using (2.23) (isothermal model).
Also, one can further incorporate the effects of the variation of the
ground temperature (seasonal changes) by replacing B2 by B2ref(To/Tref)^alpha,
where B2ref is the value of the reference temperature Tref and To is the
actual ground temperature. The value quoted in the text is approximate for
T = 300K. In particular, how much effect will the adiabatic model have on the
maximum range and the launch angle to achieve it? How much do they vary from
a cold day in winter to a hot summer day?
