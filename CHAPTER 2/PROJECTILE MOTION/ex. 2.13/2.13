2.13. Construct a program to calculate the trajectory of a baseball,
as in Figure 2.7. Use it to investigate the following questions:

(a) Calculate the range at sea level, with no wind, of a ball hit at
110 mph for different initial angles. Determine to within 1° the angle
that gives the maximum range.

(b) Determine the initial angles that give the maximum range for a ball
hit at 110 mph into a 25-mph head wind, and with a 25-mph tail wind.
What are the maximum ranges in the two cases?

(c) In all of our calculations we have assumed that the initial velocity
is 110 mph, a value typical for a good power hitter. How much does the
range depend on this value? Calculate the range for initial velocities
of 120 and 100 mph. How does the range scale with the initial kinetic
energy of the ball and why?

(d) Calculate how much a fastball slows
down on its way to home plate. Assume a pitch that leaves the pitcher’s
hand at 100 mph and find its speed when it crosses home plate, which is
60.5 ft away.
