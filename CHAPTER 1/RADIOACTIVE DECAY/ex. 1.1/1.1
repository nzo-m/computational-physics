The velocity of a freely falling object near Earth's surface is described
by the equation dv/dt = -g (1.8) where v is the velocity and g = 9.8 m/s^2
is the acceleration due to gravity. Write a program that employs the Euler
method to compute the solution to (1.8); that is, calculate v as a function
of t. For simplicity, assume that the initial velocity is zero that is,
the object starts from rest and calculate the solution for times t=0 to t=10 s.
Repeat the calculation for several different values of the time step, and
compare the results with the exact solution to (1.8). It turns out that for this
case the euler method gives the exact result.
