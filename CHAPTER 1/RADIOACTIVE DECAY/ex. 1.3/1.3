1.3. It is often the case that the frictional force on an object
will increase as the object moves faster. A fortunate example of
this is a parachutist; the role of the parachute is to produce a
frictional force due to air drag, which is larger than would normally
be the case without the parachute. Here we consider a very simple
example in which the frictional force depends on the velocity.
Assume that the velocity of an object obeys an equation of the form
dv/dt = a - bv, (1.10) where a and b are constants. You could think
of a as coming from an applied force, such as gravity, while b
arises from friction. Note that the frictional force is negative
(we assume that b> 0), so that it opposes the motion, and that it
increases in magnitude as the velocity increases. Use the Euler
method to solve (1.10) for v as a function of time. A convenient
choice of parameters is a = 10 and b = 1. You should find that v approaches
a constant value at long times; this is called the terminal velocity.
