*1.4. Consider a radioactive decay problem involving two types of
nuclei, A and B, with populations NA(t) and NB(t).
Suppose that type A nuclei decay to form type B nuclei, which then
also decay, according to the differential equations
dNA/dt = -NA/TA ; dNB/dt = NA/TA - NB/TB (1.11).
where TA and TB are the decay time constants for each type of
nucleus. Use the Euler method to solve these coupled equations for NA
and NB as functions of time. This problem can also be solved exactly,
as was the case with our original nuclear decay problem (1.1).
Obtain the analytic solutions for NA(t) and Na(t), and compare them with your
numerical results. It is also interesting to explore the behavior found
for different values of the ratio TA/TB. In particular, try to interpret
the short and long time behaviors for different values of this ratio.
