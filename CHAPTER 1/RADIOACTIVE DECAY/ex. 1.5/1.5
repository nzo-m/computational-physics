*1.5. Consider again a decay problem with two types of nuclei A and B,
but now suppose that nuclei of type A decay into ones of type B,
while nuclei of type B decay into ones of type A. Strictly speaking,
this is not a "decay" process, since it is possible for the type B
nuclei to turn back into type A nuclei. A better analogy would be a
resonance in which a system can tunnel or move back and forth between
two states A and B which have equal energies. The corresponding
rate equations are
dNA/dt = NB/tau - NA/tau,
dNb/dt = NA/tau - NB/tau (1.12)
where for simplicity we have assumed that the two types of decay are
characterized by the same time constant, tau. Solve this system of
equations for the numbers of nuclei, NA and NB, as functions of time.
Consider different initial conditions, such as NA 100, NB = 0, etc.,
and take tau = 1 s. Show that your numerical results are consistent with
the idea that the system reaches a steady state in which NA and NB are
constant. In such a steady state, the time derivatives dNA/dt and
dNB/dt should vanish.
