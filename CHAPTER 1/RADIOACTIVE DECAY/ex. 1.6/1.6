1.6. Population growth problems often give rise to rate equations
that are first-order. For example, the equation
dN/dt = aN - bN^2 (1.13),
might describe how the number of individuals in a population, N,
varies with time. Here the first term aN corresponds to the birth
of new members, while the second term -bN2 corresponds to deaths.
The death term is proportional to N^2 to allow for the fact that
food will become harder to find when the population N becomes large.
Begin by solving (1.13) with b = 0 using the Euler method, and
compare your numerical result with the exact solution. Then
solve (1.13) with nonzero values b. Give an intuitive explanation
of your results. Interesting values of a and b depend on the
initial population N. For small N(0), a = 10 and b = 3 is a good
choice, while for N(0) = 1000 a good choice is a = 10 and b = 0.01.
